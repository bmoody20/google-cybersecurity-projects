# Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity

## Why This Topic Matters
Cybersecurity only works when you understand the fundamental principles, not just tools. 
This course provided grounding in how organisations think about security risks, why incidents happen and what defenders are expected to do. 
These foundations shaped how I analyse threats, prioritise what matters and communicate in a structured, analyst-focused way.

## What I Learned

### 1. Security Principles
- CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Defence-in-depth and layered security
- Zero trust fundamentals
- Authentication vs authorisation

### 2. Security Roles & Functions
- SOC roles and escalation paths
- Incident lifecycle: Preparation → Detection → Analysis → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned
- How analysts work with IT, legal, HR, and leadership teams

### 3. Threat Landscape Awareness
- Common attack patterns (phishing, malware, insider threats, social engineering)
- Difference between threat, vulnerability, risk
- Impact vs likelihood and how organisations prioritise security controls

### 4. Governance & Frameworks
- Overview of NIST CSF
- High-level understanding of NIST SP 800-53 controls
- How compliance ties into business decisions

## Example Analysis (My Own Work)

Scenario:
A healthcare company suffers a ransomware attack following a phishing email.

Approach:
- Identified the 5 W’s (Who/What/Where/When/Why)
- Determined the likely entry point (credential harvesting → initial access)
- Mapped attacker behaviour to the incident phases
- Proposed improvements including MFA, email filtering, privilege reduction, and employee training
- Highlighted the operational impact and risk to patient data

This structured breakdown reflects how SOC analysts communicate during incidents.

## Reflection
This course made cybersecurity feel real.
It showed that effective security is not only about tools, it is about understanding risk, protecting people and thinking analytically under pressure. 
These foundations changed the way I break down problems, spot patterns and communicate clearly like a Junior Analyst.
