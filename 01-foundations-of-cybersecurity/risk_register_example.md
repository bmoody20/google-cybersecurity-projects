Risk Register (Foundations Example)

📘 Risk Register Overview

A risk register helps security analysts track and prioritise risks by evaluating:

Asset — what needs protection

Threat — what could cause harm

Vulnerability — why the threat is possible

Likelihood — probability of exploitation

Impact — severity of damage

Risk Score — likelihood × impact

Recommended Controls — how to mitigate it

🎯 Key Takeaways (Analytical Insight)

High-risk items share two traits: high likelihood + high impact.

Most risks come from access mismanagement or lack of monitoring.

Controls must be mapped proportionally: high-risk issues justify stronger, layered controls.
