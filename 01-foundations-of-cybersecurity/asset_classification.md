## Why Asset Classification Matters

Classification supports:

- Prioritisation of security resources  
- Data handling rules  
- Access permissions  
- Incident response planning

## 📂 Example Asset Classification

| Asset | Type | Sensitivity | Criticality | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|--------|

## 🔐 Classification Levels Used

- **Internal** — staff-only  
- **Confidential** — restricted to certain roles  
- **Restricted** — highest sensitivity; need-to-know only

- Monitoring  
- Protective controls
