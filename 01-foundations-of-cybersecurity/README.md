# Foundations of Cybersecurity  
**Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate — Course 1**  
**Status:** Completed ✔️

This section demonstrates my understanding of core cybersecurity principles, risk fundamentals and the mindset required in analyst roles. 
It includes structured documentation, applied exercises, and reflections written in a professional, SOC-ready style.

## 🧠 Key Skills Developed
- Understanding of the CIA Triad and AAA security principles  
- Ability to identify threats, vulnerabilities, and risks  
- Familiarity with frameworks (NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-30, ISO 27001)  
- Understanding SOC structure, incident-response lifecycle, and analyst workflows  
- Knowledge of authentication, authorization, and access control models (RBAC, ABAC, ACLs)  
- Strong technical documentation and incident-reporting skills

## 🔍 Mini-Projects & Professional-Style Deliverables

### **1. Incident Response Report — Ransomware Attack**
A healthcare organisation experienced a ransomware breach following a successful phishing attack. I produced a structured analyst report outlining:

- **Root cause analysis** using attack-chain thinking  
- **Phishing vector evaluation** and user behaviour analysis  
- **Attack progression** (Initial access → Execution → Encryption)  
- **Impact assessment** on critical systems  
- **Recommended mitigations**, including:
  - Email filtering & sandboxing
  - MFA and strong IAM policies
  - Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
  - Regular off-network backups
  - Phishing-awareness training  

This showcases my ability to analyse incidents and recommend realistic, risk-aligned controls.

### **2. Governance & Control Assessment (NIST CSF)**
I mapped organisational activities to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover), identified gaps, and proposed improvements:

- Missing classification policies  
- Unclear access-control boundaries  
- Weak password practices  
- Lack of continuous monitoring  
- No incident-response tabletop exercises  

This deliverable demonstrates my ability to interpret frameworks and translate them into actionable business recommendations.

### **3. Threat, Vulnerability & Risk Breakdown**
I performed a structured analysis that included:

- Threat identification  
- Vulnerability enumeration  
- Likelihood and impact scoring  
- Risk priority calculation  
- Mitigation strategies  

This reflects the type of reasoning expected in daily SOC triage and risk assessments.

## 💬 Personal Reflection
This course built the foundation for my cybersecurity journey. I developed a strong understanding of how organisations think about risk, how security controls map to business objectives, and how analysts document and communicate findings. It also strengthened my analytical thinking and prepared me for hands-on work in later modules.
